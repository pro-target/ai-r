An agent reports: "done X, per plan Y." You have no way to check. The plan lives
in one format, the edits in another. And if two agents worked the task, their
histories don't reconcile at all — each writes its own way, in its own place.
`ai-r` reads an agent's session history and pulls out the intent, the plan, and
the authorship behind an edit.

## Quick example — an agent asks about history

The primary mode is **MCP**: an agent (Claude, Codex, …) calls `ai-r` directly
and asks about history in plain language. For example — pull the plan the
previous agent settled on, drafts discarded:

```
Show me the plan from the last session — final only, no intermediate revisions.
→ ai-r: plan(session=…, kind="final")  →  get_body(id, shallow=true)
        returns the final task + a list of dropped_drafts
```

Fast edit attribution — one terminal command, across every agent at once:

```bash
# who edited this file, and when — cross-agent, optionally time-boxed
ai-r find-file-edits auth.py --since 2026-06-01
```

## What hurts

- "Done, I did X per plan Y" — with nothing to check it against: the agent keeps
  the plan in one shape, the edits in another.
- You switched agents mid-task and lost the thread. There's nowhere to ask "what
  did the *other* agent already try?"
- An edit shows up in a file — and it's unclear **which** agent made it, and on
  what request.

One cause: every agent writes its history **its own way** — Claude and Codex in
JSONL, OpenCode in SQLite, Antigravity in "brain" directories, Pi in
per-project JSONL. Five formats, five layouts — together they don't reconcile.

## The promise

`ai-r` folds all five into **one read-only interface**. Point any agent — or a
script, or yourself — at any session, no matter which tool recorded it. One
query shape per agent; format differences are normalized inside the parsers.

## Key features

- **"Why?", not just "What?".** Extracts the plan, intent, and authorship behind
  an edit — not just the diff text. `git diff` tells you *what* changed; `ai-r`
  tells you under which plan and on whose request.
- **The final plan, not the drafts.** `ai-r` pulls the plan the agent *settled
  on*, and separately shows what it threw away along the way (`dropped_drafts`)
  — across Claude / Codex / Antigravity, where the plan signals differ.
- **Cross-agent attribution.** Any file edit or tool call → the agent that made
  it, plus the request that triggered it (`find-file-edits` / `find-tool-calls`).
- **Small answer, body on demand.** Records carry a reference to the content
  (hash + length); the full edit text is fetched separately — the response
  doesn't balloon.
- **Works over MCP (13 tools).** An agent calls `ai-r` directly in plain
  language; the same data is available from the terminal (CLI) and from code
  (Python SDK).
- **A reader, not a guard.** Extracts entities; you (or your tool) build the
  knowledge graph and the memory. Read-only: it never runs or writes to an
  agent's history.

## What you use it for

- **Audit sessions with a fresh pair of eyes.** A new agent with an empty
  context coldly checks past sessions on three axes: were promises and
  requirements met; are the decisions sound and well-judged; how deeply was the
  question explored — what the agent missed. On one real run, 271 dialogs were
  reviewed this way in a week, catching agents that finished the task **but
  misled on the planning** — something a live chat hides, and that steers you
  into wrong decisions.
- **Continue past a spent context — without losing detail.** `/compact` erases
  the specifics. Instead, open a fresh session: it reads the previous session's
  **logs** and continues from its conclusions, without re-burning context on
  what's already been worked out. The original session stays intact — for audit
  and search. The new session can run in **any** agent: the history reconciles
  regardless of the tool.
- **Feeds your memory system.** Keeping memory and summaries à la Karpathy, or
  your own method? `ai-r` gives you, for AI chats, what you already do with
  message history — parsed entities to build a lasting memory of the details
  that matter.
- **Recall what you did and why.** Why was this file edited? Why was this rule
  added? Find the session where the file changed and read the request *before*
  the edit.

## How it differs from session-search tools

A handful of cross-agent tools now read more than one agent's history
(`jazzyalex/agent-sessions`, `Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search`,
`hacktivist123/agent-session-resume`). Almost all are about **search and
timeline**: find a *session*, scroll the history.

`ai-r` goes deeper: it extracts the **plan, intent, and authorship as ready-made
entities** you build memory on. Search finds text — `ai-r` answers **why**.
Technically a search tool could also dig a plan out of a session's text, but it
doesn't hand it back parsed into a single, normalized shape — with `ai-r` that's
the primary surface.

| Capability | Single-agent viewers | Cross-agent search tools | `ai-r` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reads >1 agent's logs | No | Yes | Yes — Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Antigravity, Pi |
| Programmatic surface | Mostly GUI/TUI | Mostly TUI/CLI/app | **MCP + CLI + Python SDK** |
| Attribution (edit/command → agent + intent) | — | Partial | Yes — `find-file-edits` / `find-tool-calls` |
| Audit replay (reconstruct a session's changes, no git) | — | Rarely | Yes — `session_diff` |
| Plan extraction (final vs draft, normalized) | — | — | Yes — `plan` |
| Scope | Viewer | Search / resume / memory | **Read-only extraction core** |

*Competitor columns reflect their public docs as of 2026-07; where a capability
is unclear we under-state rather than over-claim.*

We deliberately **don't** compete on agent breadth, speed, or TUI richness.
`ai-r`'s wedge is extracting the "why" and structured entities for machine
consumption.

## Proven in practice

`ai-r` already reads its own development history — across all five agents. Real
tools run on it (they live separately, on top of its read-only API):

- **auditor** — a fresh agent coldly checks what the previous one actually did
  and decided. This caught agents that quietly fibbed about the plan.
- **summarizer** (`export rounds`) — renders a session into a ready handoff doc.
- **ai-local-reader** — a read-only skill: audits past sessions from disk across
  all agents.

These tools are workflow-side, outside this repo. `ai-r` itself only reads and
returns data.

## Supported agents

| Agent | Storage | Parser |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/projects/` | JSONL |
| Codex | `~/.codex/sessions/` | JSONL |
| OpenCode | `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` | SQLite (snap/flatpak auto-detect) |
| Antigravity | `~/.gemini/antigravity/brain/` | JSON / markdown brain directories |
| Pi | `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<encoded-cwd>/*.jsonl` | JSONL |

Not your agent? Adding a sixth is **one parser module**; the read-only pattern
ports to any tool in minutes. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Surfaces

`ai-r` gives the same reading power three ways:

- **MCP server** (`ai-r-mcp`) — 13 tools over stdio JSON-RPC, so any MCP agent
  calls it directly (recommended). Registration — see
  [docs/mcp-registration.md](./docs/mcp-registration.md).
- **CLI** (`ai-r`) — subcommands for scripts and manual use (`list` / `read` /
  `search` / `find-file-edits` / `find-tool-calls` / `file-frequency` /
  `detect-agent` / `export rounds`). Search operators —
  [docs/search-operators.md](./docs/search-operators.md).
- **Python SDK** (`from ai_r.parsers import ...`) — parsers, typed
  `Session`/message models, and the event verbs, to build your own tools.

### Method vocabulary (SSOT)

The block below is framed from [`docs/methods.md`](./docs/methods.md) — the
English source of truth for the public verbs and presets. It's kept in sync with
that file's marker block.

<!-- methods:start -->

## Verbs

| verb | purpose | parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `query` | filter/search session events — emitted `text` is a ~160-char **preview** (cut applied after redaction; a real cut carries a trailing `…` + `text_truncated: true`), full body on-demand via `get_body`; `with_intent=True` → a top-level `intent` on each event (the same `previous_user_intent` as legacy); a `tool_call` event carries an `is_error` outcome ref when its result is correlatable (see *Output bounds & outcome* below) | type, agent, session, since, until, file, tool, text, sort(relevance\|date), relative_to+direction(prev\|next)+n(1\|all), step_type, limit, with_intent, noise(include\|exclude\|only), project_dir, redact; kind/parent/group — stubs (Phase 3) |
| `plan` | normalized plan atoms of a session (final vs drafts, grouped by task) | session, kind(draft\|final\|completed_major), group=task, agent, redact |
| `get_body` | on-demand body by event/plan id; returned body/text is bounded by `max_chars` (default 500k) → over-long bodies are cut with a marker and flagged `body_truncated` | id, shallow, max_chars, redact |
| `aggregate` | rollup over rows (query/find_file_edits/session-inventory) → `{groups, totals}`; `rank_by=stats` gives the session_stats order (sessions→edits→label), `kind_split=True` adds `kind_split_available`/`note` | rows, group_by(field\|callable), metrics ⊆ count\|sessions\|edits\|intents\|agents\|messages\|files, rank_by(default\|stats), kind_split |
| `diff` | stitch edit-rows into a per-file unified diff (bodies on-demand via message_index; `intent` taken from the row when `query(with_intent)`) → `{files:[{file,edits,diff,hunks}], count, caveats}` | rows, per_file=True, format=unified, redact |
| `detect_current` | runtime identity (env/fs, outside session-query) → `{session_id, agent, candidates[], verified, self}` | agent (hint) |

## Presets

| preset | expansion |
|---|---|
| `intent(event, n)` | `query(relative_to=event, direction=prev, n)` |
| `reaction(event, n)` | `query(relative_to=event, direction=next, n)` |
| `plan(session, kind, group=task)` | `query(type=plan_event, …)` → normalized + kind-tagged (final/draft/completed_major) |
| `session_stats(group_by)` | builds per-session inventory rows → `aggregate(rows, group_by, rank_by=stats, kind_split=True)` → projection to the legacy totals shape |
| `session_diff(uuid, agent≠codex)` | `diff(query(type=edit\|write, session=uuid, with_intent=True) with file-ref)` → projection (no file-level `hunks`) |

## Legacy tools: presets over verbs (Phase 3b)

Phase 3b enriched the verbs so old tools became thin presets **with byte-identical output, proven on REAL data** (frozen snapshot `~/.claude`, so the live vault doesn't mutate mid-run — that produced false mismatches). The legacy suites (`test_session_stats`/`test_session_diff`) are green — the second half of the compatibility proof.

**Ported to verbs (byte-parity proven):**

| tool | preset over verb | proof |
|---|---|---|
| `session_stats` | `aggregate(rank_by=stats, kind_split=True)` over per-session inventory rows | 8/8 (group_by∈agent\|dir\|date\|kind × top∈8\|0) EQUAL on the snapshot; the key is `rank_by=stats` reproducing the sessions-first rank, `kind_split` giving `kind_split_available`/`note` |
| `session_diff` (≠codex) | `diff(query(edit\|write, with_intent=True))` | 12/12 real Claude sessions EQUAL; the key is `with_intent` returning `intent`, a single chronological stream giving the same file order, the edit\|write filter excluding `Read` (else extra files) |

**Codex — exception in `session_diff`:** codex writes files via shell-exec, and the target is recovered by scanning the command line, which the event stream does NOT do → shell-redirect edits would vanish from the `query` fold. So the codex branch of `session_diff` keeps the legacy `_scan_session` (byte-parity for all agents).

**Stay separate (justified):**

| tool | why NOT a preset |
|---|---|
| `find_file_edits` / `find_tool_calls` | the record carries `session_title`/`session_date`/`assistant`/`input`, which are NOT in a `query` event; `find_tool_calls` additionally carries per-record `is_error` (correlated tool-call outcome) and `output` (correlated tool-result content, char-capped); reproducing them = re-reading the session (not a *thin* preset but a second parse over events — strictly slower) + loss of codex shell-redirect edits. `intent` is now reproducible (`with_intent`), but the other fields are not. SSOT of the rich edit/tool record |
| `search_sessions` | session-granular + BM25 session snippets; `query` is event-granular (turn/tool) → no clean 1:1 |
| `detect-agent`/`detect-session` (CLI) | the CLI prints the agent `source` and 6 output modes (list/first/strict/self/fingerprint/`--json`/`--count`) + a WARN line; the `detect_current` dict does not provide this |

## Plan atom (normalized, agent differences hidden)

`Plan { id, session_id, agent, title, task_id, kind: draft\|final\|completed_major, path?, steps?, status?, refs[], sha256 }`. Body/steps — on-demand via `get_body(id, shallow?)`. `shallow=True` → only the task's final, draft bodies dropped (scenario S6).

**Grouping by task = `task_id` (stable key):** for Claude it's the plan slug `plans/<slug>.md` (Write carries the path directly; `ExitPlanMode` without a path inherits the slug of the nearest preceding plan-Write in the session; if there is no slug yet — fallback to the normalized title). For Antigravity — the `implementation_plan.md` path. For Codex (no file) — the normalized title (a continuous `update_plan` run). Keyed by slug, NOT by title, because the title drifts within one iteration chain (decorations change the heading) — on real data that split one task into several. In a group the last plan_event by (ts, seq) = `final`, the earlier ones = `draft`; strictly earlier tasks (a DIFFERENT slug) = `completed_major`. The internal parser→signal table (`ExitPlanMode`/`Write plans/*.md`/`update_plan`/`implementation_plan.md`) is an implementation detail, invisible from outside.

## Noise filter (session-level)

A session is *noise* when it is not a top-level human-driven conversation — today that means **spawned subagent (sidechain) sessions**: `kind == "subagent"` or `parent_uuid` set (criterion SSOT: `src/ai_r/parsers/_noise.py`). `query`, `list_sessions` and `search_sessions` take `noise ∈ {include, exclude, only}` (default `include` — fully backward-compatible): `exclude` keeps only top-level agent sessions, `only` keeps only the subagent tree (audit view). The filter applies at the *session* level before any message is read (an excluded session costs nothing), composes with the other filters by AND (incl. `list_sessions(kind=…)`), and an unknown mode fails loud (`invalid_argument`). In `query` it is ignored on the `relative_to` walk (the anchor pins one concrete session), like every other facet.

**Subagent-detection coverage (parser-internal normalization, one public criterion):** **Claude** — `subagents/` directory layout + sidechain `parentUuid`; **OpenCode** — `session.parent_id`; **Codex** — `session_meta.payload.thread_source == "subagent"` + `parent_thread_id` (incl. the nested `source.subagent.thread_spawn.parent_thread_id` fallback); **Pi** — the `parentSession` header field. **Antigravity** — no parent signal in the format → always `kind="agent"`, never noise. Warmup/scaffold sessions are **not** classified as noise: no agent format carries a reliable cheap marker for them and a title heuristic would misfire, so the criterion stays exact (noise == subagent) rather than guessed.

## Claude session sources (CLI + Desktop overlay)

The Claude parser scans **two roots** and merges them into one session list (F1.3):

- **CLI root** — `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<uuid>.jsonl`: the transcripts (`$AI_R_HOME/.claude/projects` when `AI_R_HOME` is set).
- **Desktop root** — `~/.config/Claude/claude-code-sessions/<device>/<workspace>/local_*.json` (`$AI_R_HOME/.config/Claude/claude-code-sessions` under `AI_R_HOME`): the Claude **Desktop** app's own store. It holds **metadata only** — one JSON object per session (`sessionId`, `cliSessionId`, `title` + `titleSource`, `cwd`, epoch-ms timestamps, `model`, `permissionMode`), NOT transcripts: a Desktop-launched session's transcript still lives in the CLI root under `cliSessionId`.

**Merge rules:** dedup key is the session uuid (`cliSessionId` == the CLI JSONL stem) — a session visible in both roots is returned ONCE, enriched: the Desktop `title` wins (it is the title the user sees in the app, hence what they will search for; the CLI-derived title is preserved as `extra["cli_title"]`). Origin is marked in `extra["source_root"]`: `"desktop"` = the session was driven from the Desktop app (a *launch-surface* signal; F1.4 surfaces it first-class as `launch_surface="claude-desktop"`), `"cli"` = plain CLI session (`launch_surface="claude-cli"`). A uuid present ONLY in the Desktop store (transcript deleted) still appears as a **reference-only** session — `message_count == 0`, reading its messages returns an empty list (honest answer, not an error), `path` points at the metadata JSON. A missing root is skipped, never an error. The overlay applies uniformly to `list_sessions` / `read_session` / `search` / `session_exists`; `source_roots()` reports both roots so empty-result diagnostics can name them. Hermetic-test note: an explicit `base_dir` **without** an explicit desktop root pins the scan to the CLI root only, so fixture-scoped callers never leak the real HOME.

## Session origin (`project_dir` + `launch_surface`)

Every session summary (`list_sessions` / `read_session` / `search_sessions` candidates) carries two first-class origin fields next to `kind`/`parent_uuid`, both `null` when the source format has no signal — **absence is honest, never fabricated**:

- **`project_dir`** — the project directory the session ran in. Per-agent signal (parser-internal normalization, one public field): **Claude** — the record-level `cwd` of the CLI transcript; fallback to the Desktop metadata `cwd`/`originCwd` (F1.3 overlay), then to a **filesystem-verified** decode of the `projects/<slug>` storage encoding (the slug flattens `/` and `.` to `-`, so a dash inside a real name is ambiguous — the decoder searches the possible segment boundaries and accepts only a path that actually exists as a directory; unverifiable → `null`, no guessing). **Codex** — `session_meta.payload.cwd`. **OpenCode** — the `session.directory` column (legacy DBs predating the column degrade to `null` via a legacy-SELECT fallback, enumeration never breaks). **Pi** — the session-header `cwd`. **Antigravity** — the format carries no structured cwd/directory field → always `null`.
- **`launch_surface`** — the concrete surface the session was driven from, only where the data makes it distinguishable: **Claude** — `"claude-cli"` | `"claude-desktop"` (from the F1.3 Desktop-overlay signal). **Codex** — the raw `session_meta.payload.originator` string passed through verbatim (observed: `"codex_vscode"`, `"Codex Desktop"`; no invented taxonomy on top of the raw value). **Antigravity** — `"antigravity-ide"` | `"antigravity-cli"` (which brain root holds the session: `~/.gemini/antigravity/brain` is the IDE app, `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain` is the CLI). **OpenCode**/**Pi** — no signal in the format → always `null` (OpenCode's `agent` column is the *mode* — plan/build — not a surface).

**`project_dir` filter** on `list_sessions` and `query`: keeps only sessions whose `project_dir` equals the given path **or is a descendant of it** — path-boundary aware (`/a/b` matches `/a/b` and `/a/b/sub`, never the sibling `/a/bc`), trailing slashes ignored, no other normalisation (`~`/`..`/symlinks are compared as recorded). Chosen over exact-only because "sessions of this project" must include sessions started in a subdirectory of the project root. Sessions with `project_dir=null` never match (absence is not a wildcard). Applied at the *session* level before any message is read (like `noise`), composes with the other filters by AND, ignored on the `relative_to` walk, and an empty/blank filter value fails loud (`invalid_argument`). Semantics SSOT: `src/ai_r/parsers/_common.py::project_dir_matches`.

## Resume command (`resume_command`)

Every session summary carries `resume_command` (F2.2, next to `project_dir`/`launch_surface`): the exact shell one-liner that reopens the conversation in its agent's CLI, or `null` when no real command exists — **absence is honest, never fabricated; the field is text only, ai-r never executes it**. Commands are verified against the installed CLIs' own `--help`, not invented:

| agent | command | why this shape |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | `cd <project_dir> && claude --resume <uuid>` | `claude --resume` resolves the id against the project store of the *current working directory* → the `cd` prefix makes the command work from any shell; with `project_dir=null` the bare `claude --resume <uuid>` is emitted (works only when already inside the original project dir). A **reference-only Desktop session** (transcript deleted, F1.3) → `null` — nothing to resume. |
| Codex | `cd <project_dir> && codex resume <uuid>` | `codex resume <SESSION_ID>` is id-addressable in the global store (the cwd filter only affects the interactive picker); the `cd` prefix keeps the continued session in its original directory (Codex always records `cwd` → the prefix is always present). |
| OpenCode | `cd <project_dir> && opencode --session <id>` | main-command flag `-s, --session` ("session id to continue"); project-scoped TUI → `cd` prefix when `session.directory` is known (legacy DBs without the column → bare command). |
| Pi | `cd <project_dir> && pi --session <path>` | `pi --session <path\|id>`: the *id* lookup is scoped to the current project's session dir, while the recorded session-**file path** is unambiguous from anywhere → the path form is emitted. |
| Antigravity | `null` | sessions are IDE brain directories with no CLI resume verb; the local `gemini` CLI's `--resume` addresses its **own** store by index/`latest`, not brain-dir ids → no real command exists. |

Cross-agent rules: **subagent (sidechain) sessions are never resumable** (`kind="subagent"`/`parent_uuid` set → `null` — the CLIs resume top-level interactive conversations, not spawned tool threads); every interpolated value (uuid/path/dir) is shell-quoted. Semantics SSOT: `src/ai_r/resume.py::resume_command`.

## Output bounds & tool-call outcome

**Bounded output (untrusted sessions can be huge — the surface never returns unbounded bytes):** `find_tool_calls` caps each record's `input`/`assistant`/`intent`/`output` fields (over-long values cut with a `…[truncated]` marker and named in a per-record `truncated_fields`) and stops appending once a total-response byte budget is hit, flagging `output_truncated`; this is distinct from the count-based `truncated` (more records exist). `get_body` bounds the body via `max_chars` (`body_truncated`). Tool input larger than 1 MB is never JSON-decoded (returned verbatim) — a shared guard on the event stream and `find_tool_calls` alike. `read_session` renders a tool result as `[tool_result ok: <snippet>]` or `[tool_result ERROR: <snippet>]` (was a bare `[tool_result]`).

**Adaptive output truncation (`output_mode`):** the per-record `output` cap is `_OUTPUT_CHARS_CAP = 2000` chars. How that budget is spent is controlled by `output_mode ∈ {"head", "tail", "smart"}`. The default (`output_mode=None`) is **adaptive per record**: a record with `is_error == True` is truncated `"smart"` (surface the error lines — `error`/`fatal`/`traceback`/… — plus the tail, so an error at the *end* of a long log is not lost to a head-only cut), while a successful record is truncated `"head"` (legacy behaviour). An explicit `output_mode` forces one strategy for every record. `smart`/`tail` may return up to ~2× the cap to keep both the surfaced lines and the tail; whenever `output` is cut it is still named in that record's `truncated_fields`.

**Filtering `find_tool_calls` (all optional, composed by AND):** beyond `tool_name`/`tool_name_pattern`, records can be narrowed by `input_contains` (case-insensitive substring over the serialized tool input / command text), `output_contains` (ci substring over the correlated `output`), `output_excludes` (drop a record whose `output` contains the marker — a caller-supplied noise filter, e.g. a harness security-gate line, `"user rejected"`, `"MANUAL COMMIT BLOCKED"`; **no such list is hard-coded in the core**), and `is_error` (tri-state: `None` = all, `True` = errors only, `False` = successes only). All filters intersect (AND). There is **no** dedicated "error + domain" verb: that pairing is a *composition* — e.g. `find_tool_calls(input_contains="git", is_error=True)` returns the real command failures of a chosen domain (`git` is just an example domain, not a special case).

**`is_error` (tool-call outcome) is cross-agent best-effort:** **Claude** and **OpenCode** carry a real success/error flag (Claude's `tool_result.is_error`; OpenCode's `state.status == "error"`). **Codex** and **Pi** expose no error field on their result records → `is_error` is always `False` (absence of a flag, not a proof of success). **Antigravity** emits no tool-result records at all → no outcome signal. Consumers must not read a cross-agent `is_error=False` as "verified success" for Codex/Pi/Antigravity. `find_tool_calls` now carries the same `is_error` per record, plus the correlated `output` (tool-result content, char-capped) — correlation is by tool_use_id (Claude `tool_use.id` / OpenCode `callID`); with the same best-effort caveat (`is_error` is authoritative only for Claude/OpenCode, and defaults to `False` for Codex/Pi/Antigravity or when no result correlates). To make that honesty machine-readable, each `find_tool_calls` record also carries `is_error_reliable` (bool): `True` for Claude/OpenCode (a real flag backs the value), `False` for Codex/Pi/Antigravity (no source → `is_error` is always `False` and may **undercount** true failures). A consumer filtering `is_error=True` should read `is_error_reliable` to know whether a `False` means "verified success" or merely "no signal".

## Redaction (secrets masked on output)

Real transcripts routinely contain pasted secrets, so **every method that emits session-derived text masks them on output by default** (F2.1). Emitting surfaces: `query` (`text`/`intent`), `get_body` (`text`/`body`/`title`/`steps`), `plan` (title/steps/refs), `diff` & `session_diff` (diff text/hunks/intents), `read_session` (title + message content), `search_sessions` (title/snippet), `list_sessions` (title), `find_file_edits` & `find_tool_calls` (title/intent/assistant/input/output). Each replacement is `[REDACTED_<TYPE>]`; when anything was masked the response carries a `redactions` type→count dict (absent = nothing masked). `redact=false` on any of these returns the raw content. `session_stats`/`aggregate` emit only counts/labels derived from rows the caller already holds — no session text of their own, hence no `redact` parameter; `detect_current` reads the runtime env, not transcripts.

**Types:** `PRIVATE_KEY` (PEM blocks), `AWS_KEY`/`AWS_SECRET`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_KEY`, `OPENAI_KEY`, `SLACK_TOKEN`, `URL_CREDENTIALS` (`user:pass@` in URLs — only the credential span is masked), `BEARER_TOKEN` (value only, the `Bearer` prefix survives), `GENERIC_SECRET` (an explicit secret-ish key name — `password`/`token`/`api_key`/… — assigned a token-shaped value). Pattern SSOT: `src/ai_r/redact.py`. **Bias against false positives:** uuids, git hashes and prose like `sk-learn` or `Bearer authentication` never trip (value patterns require a digit; the generic catch-all requires a key name + `:`/`=`); the honest trade-off is that an all-letter password under a generic key is not masked.

**Emission-time only:** redaction never touches scanning or matching — every filter (`text`, `input_contains`, search queries, …) matches the RAW stored text, so searching for a literal secret still finds its session (only the displayed output is masked), and a `[REDACTED_*]` placeholder can never match as a search term. The empty-result diagnostics say this out loud: a filter value that IS a placeholder, or that itself looks like a secret, earns a hint explaining that redaction is output-only and suggesting `redact=false` for raw output.

## Empty results & session lookup

**Empty-result diagnostics (a zero-result response explains itself, never a bare empty list):** when a scanning method — `query`, `search_sessions`, `find_tool_calls`, `find_file_edits`, `list_sessions` — matches nothing, the response carries a `diagnostics` object next to the empty list/count. Shape: `scanned` (one entry per scanned agent — `sessions` count, `date_min`/`date_max`, `source_found`, plus a per-agent `hint` such as `source not found: ~/.pi/agent/sessions` or `source present but contains no sessions`), `corpus` (total sessions + overall date bounds), `filters` (echo of the active filters), `hints` (cause candidates: a `since`/`until` bound that excludes the entire corpus is called out explicitly — e.g. `since='2030-01-01' is after the newest session (…) — the date filter excludes the entire corpus`; otherwise the remaining filters are named, or the result is declared a genuine no-match). Diagnostics are computed only on the empty path — a non-empty response never carries (or pays for) them — and never crash the response (an unreadable source degrades to a per-agent hint).

**`read_session` no longer requires `agent`:** the parameter is optional. When omitted, the id is looked up across every parser (session ids are unique across agents in practice). A rare cross-agent id collision returns `{ambiguous: true, candidates: [...], count}` — a disambiguation list where each candidate carries its `agent`, NOT an error; re-ask with an explicit `agent`. A miss returns `{error: "not_found", agents_scanned: [...]}`. `get_body` was already agent-free (its event id embeds the owning session).

**CLI error contract (a consumer script never sees a Python traceback):** expected failures keep the single `ai-r: <message>` stderr line + non-zero exit (1 generic / 2 ambiguous or invalid / 3 not found); an *unexpected* internal error is emitted as one structured JSON line on stderr (`{"error": "internal_error", "type", "message", "hint"}`) with exit code 1. `AI_R_DEBUG=1` re-raises the original exception for debugging.

### Event core

The verbs above are new: one **event core** replaces a pile of one-off tools.
Each parser reads one agent's logs and emits typed models, normalized into a
single agent-neutral stream — `user_turn` / `assistant_turn` / `tool_call(...)`
/ `plan_event`. A small set of verbs filters, aggregates, and diffs that stream;
agent differences (`ExitPlanMode` vs `update_plan` vs `implementation_plan.md`)
stay hidden inside the parsers — the caller sees one shape.

An honest boundary: this is **extraction of entities only** — turns, tool calls,
plans, intents, reactions. It is **not** a graph and **not** a memory store.
What you do next (knowledge graph, Obsidian, persistent memory) is on your side,
outside this repo. For the full layering and the MCP tool list, see
[docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md).

## Quick start (1 command)

Requirements: Python 3.11+ with `venv` or `pip`, and `jq` (used to auto-patch
the Claude and Antigravity MCP configs — the others don't need `jq`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pro-target/ai-r.git ~/dev/ai-r
cd ~/dev/ai-r && bash install.sh
```

The installer creates a venv, installs the runtime package, patches MCP configs
for **Claude**, **Codex**, **OpenCode**, **Antigravity** (where the configs
exist), installs the **Pi** CLI skill, and runs smoke tests.

Optional extra — `tokens`: `AI_R_EXTRAS=tokens bash install.sh` (or
`pip install "ai-r[tokens]"`) adds [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken)
for better token **estimates** on sessions whose format stores no exact usage
numbers. Fully optional: without it exact numbers still come straight from the
session files where recorded, and the fallback estimate degrades to a rough
chars/4 heuristic, honestly labeled `estimate` — never a crash.

## Boundaries: a reader, not a guard

- **Read-only.** It never runs an agent's code and never writes to its history —
  it reads and returns.
- **No graph, no memory.** It extracts entities (turns, calls, plans, intents).
  Building a knowledge graph or memory out of them is your job, not its.
- **Not an access-control layer.** Anyone who can reach the CLI, MCP server, or
  package can read any session. There's no authorization in front of the
  parsers; keep it where untrusted local processes can't reach.
- **Session content is data, not commands.** Whoever reads (auditor, summarizer)
  must treat session text as data, not instructions. See
  [Security](docs/security.md).

## Acceptance summary

Full spec: [docs/scenarios.md](docs/scenarios.md) — 56 LLM-executed end-to-end scenarios validating the whole public surface on a real vault. Kept in English as language-neutral, executable test specs.

| Function | # scenarios | Headline pass criteria |
|---|---|---|
| `query` | 10 | Facet filters return correct event shape (references, no body inlined — `text` is a ~160-char preview, a real cut flagged `text_truncated: true`, full body via `get_body`); `relative_to`+`direction` walk yields the true prev/next turn (cross-checked vs `read_session`); `text sort=relevance` is BM25-ranked; `tool_call` events carry an `is_error` outcome (cross-agent best-effort) without changing counts; session-level `noise=exclude\|include\|only` drops/isolates subagent sessions before any message is read, an unknown mode fails loud; unimplemented facets `kind`/`parent`/`group` **fail loud** ("not yet supported"), never a silent result; session-level `project_dir` filter scopes events to one project (exact-or-descendant, path-boundary aware). |
| `get_body` | 4 | Body fetched on-demand by id (turn text / plan text / codex steps); `shallow=true` on a draft id returns the task's **final** body + `dropped_drafts`; codex plan `steps`/`status` populated. |
| `aggregate` | 4 | `sum(count) == len(rows)`; `rank_by=stats` order is `(-sessions,-edits,label)`; `kind_split=true` adds `kind_split_available`+`note`; empty rows → empty result, no crash. |
| `diff` | 1 | Edit rows stitch into a per-file unified diff; bodies stay on-demand. |
| `detect_current` | 1 | Returns a sensible runtime identity (`session_id`/`agent`/`candidates`/`verified`). |
| `plan` | 5 | Tasks grouped by plan-file **slug**, not title (drifting titles stay ONE task, zero false `completed_major`); N draft + 1 final by `(ts,seq)`; cross-agent codex `update_plan` normalized; no false positive from a quoted `update_plan`; empty (not error) for agents with no plan signal. |
| `session_stats` (preset) | 3 | All 4 dims (agent/dir/date/kind) give sensible counts; degenerate kind split → `kind_split_available=false`+note; **byte-identical** to manual `aggregate(rank_by=stats, kind_split=true)` on a FROZEN snapshot. |
| `session_diff` (preset) | 2 | Claude session → per-file hunks in chronological order with intent attached (cross-checked vs `read_session`); codex session reconstructs targets from `printf >`/`cat > <<EOF`, with `tee`/`sed -i`/`cp`/`mv` documented as silently skipped. |
| `find_file_edits` | 3 | Default MCP call is **reference-by-default** (`input_sha256`+`input_chars`, NOT full `input`); `include_input=true` restores the body; body otherwise fetched on-demand via `get_body`. |
| `list_sessions` | 5 | Newest-first, paginated (`limit`/`offset`, `truncated` flag) inventory; each summary carries `kind`+`parent_uuid` (subagent detection: Claude/OpenCode/Codex/Pi; Antigravity has no signal); `agent` filter narrows the set; `noise=exclude\|include\|only` splits the inventory into top-level vs subagent sessions and composes with `kind` by AND; the Claude parser merges the CLI transcript root with the Claude Desktop metadata root — dedup by uuid, Desktop title wins (CLI title kept in `extra["cli_title"]`), origin marked `extra["source_root"]="cli"\|"desktop"`, a metadata-only session stays visible as a zero-message reference; each summary carries top-level `project_dir`+`launch_surface` (null when the format has no signal) and `project_dir` filters the inventory exact-or-descendant. |
| `resume_command` (summary field) | 1 | Every session summary carries `resume_command` — the ready-to-run CLI one-liner (`cd <project_dir> && claude --resume <uuid>` / `codex resume <uuid>` / `opencode --session <id>` / `pi --session <path>`), shell-quoted, `cd`-prefixed when `project_dir` is known; `null` exactly where no real command exists (Antigravity, subagent sessions, reference-only Desktop sessions) — text only, never executed. |
| `find_tool_calls` | 4 | Exact `tool_name` vs substring `tool_name_pattern` search, cross-agent; neither/both arguments **fail loud** (`invalid_argument`), never a silent empty result; each record surfaces the correlated `is_error` outcome + char-capped `output` (authoritative for Claude/OpenCode, best-effort elsewhere) + `is_error_reliable`; `input_contains`/`output_contains`/`output_excludes`/`is_error` filters compose by AND (domain × error without a special verb); adaptive `output_mode` (`smart` for errors) keeps a trailing error line that `head` would drop. |
| `read_session` | 3 | Reads one session into the compact `{role, content}` projection with metadata + pagination echo; `offset`/`limit` page a stable ordered list, `total` invariant across slices; `agent` is **optional** — an id resolves across every parser, a rare cross-agent id collision returns a `candidates` list (not an error), a miss names `agents_scanned`. |
| `search_sessions` | 4 | Title/body/all scope; `AND` default, `OR` widens (`AND ⊆ OR`), negative `-term` excludes, quoted phrase is contiguous; `scope=body` returns a matching `snippet`; BM25 vs date sort; `noise=exclude` removes subagent matches before scanning, `noise=only` searches only the subagent tree. |
| empty-result diagnostics (cross-cutting) | 2 | A zero-result `query`/`search_sessions`/`find_tool_calls`/`find_file_edits`/`list_sessions` response carries `diagnostics` (per-agent scan counts + date bounds + `source_found`, corpus totals, cause hints: missing source dir / all-excluding `since`/`until` / remaining filters); a non-empty response never carries it. |
| secret redaction (cross-cutting) | 3 | Every text-emitting method masks secrets on output as `[REDACTED_<TYPE>]` by default and carries a `redactions` type→count dict; `redact=false` returns the raw content; matching always runs on the RAW stored text (searching a literal secret finds its session, only the display is masked); a `[REDACTED_*]` placeholder or secret-looking filter value on an empty result earns a diagnostics hint suggesting `redact=false`. |
| CLI error contract | 1 | A failing `ai-r` CLI invocation exits non-zero with a structured error on stderr (single `ai-r: …` line, or one JSON `internal_error` line for unexpected failures) — never a Python traceback; `AI_R_DEBUG=1` re-raises for debugging. |
